## 2. Data Exploration

### 2.1 Regression- Concrete Compressive Strength
#### 2.1.1  Summary
The dataset 'Concrete_Data.csv' describes variables that contribute towards different measurements of concrete compressive strength. According to the dataset source -"The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients." It may be fair to assume then that age will have an affect on the compressive stregth along with one or more ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate. Concrete compressive stregnth is the output variable, while the other varaibles (such as ingredients and age) are input variables.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Regression: Import data for regression question - concrete compressive strength
df_concrete <- read.csv("data/Concrete_Data.csv")
```

The compressive concrete dataset requires some minor changes to the headers to make them easier to read, namely removing the units.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Regression: Rename headers (shorten the names)
colnames(df_concrete) <- c("Cement",
                           "Blast Furnace Slag",
                           "Fly Ash",
                           "Water",
                           "Superplasticizer",
                           "Coarse Aggregate",
                           "Fine Aggregate",
                           "Age",
                           "Concrete Comp. Strength")
```

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='show'}
# Regression: Summary of data
summary(df_concrete)
```

#### 2.1.2 Exploring the dependant variable

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
df_concrete_mean <- mean(df_concrete$"Concrete Comp. Strength")
df_concrete_median <- median(df_concrete$"Concrete Comp. Strength")
```
Creating a histogram of the dependant variable (compressive strength) and by investigating the mean ``r df_concrete_mean`` and median ``r df_concrete_median``  (which are similar to each other) we can see that the data appears to be normally distributed.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='show'}
# Investigating the dependant variable
hist(df_concrete$"Concrete Comp. Strength", main='Histogram of Concrete Compressive Strength', xlab='Concrete Compressive Strength')
```

#### 2.1.3 Investigating the relationships between the features

Using the 'psych' libarary we can create a scatterplot matrix to compare the relationships of all the features using pair.panels.
```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='show'}
# Creating a scatterplot matrix to investigate the relationships between the features
pairs.panels(df_concrete[c("Cement",
                           "Blast Furnace Slag",
                           "Fly Ash",
                           "Water",
                           "Superplasticizer",
                           "Coarse Aggregate",
                           "Fine Aggregate",
                           "Age",
                           "Concrete Comp. Strength")])
```

The resulting chart above shows that for cement has a stronger relationship than the other feaures to the concrete compressive strength. We can see this by the increasing sloping line and the higher correlation value between cement and comp. strength. Superplasticizer and age appears to also have a strong relationship with compressive strength.
